A native of Salem, Va., Byington returns to the Commonwealth after seven years at the helm of the Georgia Southern men's basketball program, where he led the Eagles to a 131-97 record. He was also the first GSU coach to win 20 or more games in three consecutive seasons - his final three in Statesboro - in more than 30 years. Under Byington's leadership, Georgia Southern racked up 13 all-conference selections, including Tookie Brown, who was the first Sun Belt Player of the Year in program history in 2019 and was the first player in league history to take home four First Team All-Sun Belt nods. Byington departs GSU with the highest winning percentage in conference games of any active Sun Belt head coach. Prior to his arrival, the Eagles had produced a winning season just once in seven years. In the seven years since, Byington has presided over excellence both on and off the court, notching six winning campaigns and averaging nearly 12 league wins per season while posting a 100 percent graduation rate and recording the 10 highest team grade point averages in program history across the last five years. Before earning his first full-time head coaching job in Statesboro, Byington spent seven years as the top assistant coach at College of Charleston under legendary head coach Bobby Cremins. He was also named interim head coach for the last month of the 2011-12 campaign when Cremins took a leave of absence, guiding the Cougars to a 7-4 record in their final 11 games. All told, Charleston posted a 194-100 record while Byington was in the Lowcountry, including a 108-51 mark in Southern Conference contests. The Cougars notched six 20-win seasons in his nine years, adding three SoCon regular season championships along the way. Byington began his collegiate basketball journey in the Colonial Athletic Association, where he starred for Head Coach Jerry Wainwright at UNCW before embarking on his coaching career. He was a three-year starter for the Seahawks, scoring 1,088 career points on his way to two CAA All-Academic selections, as well as Second Team All-CAA and CAA All-Defensive Team honors as a senior. He earned his bachelor's degree in physical education from UNCW in 1998. No stranger to coaching in Virginia, Byington started his coaching career at national powerhouse Hargrave Military Academy, while also making later stops at both Virginia Tech and Virginia, where he earned his master's degree in sport psychology in 2003. Prior to college, Byington was a standout at Salem High School, where he was named State Player of the Year as a senior while leading Salem to a state championship. He also picked up honorable mention All-America honors and was named First Team All-State twice. Following his senior season, he was named MVP of the Virginia High School League All Star Game.COMPLETE MARK BYINGTON COACHING HISTORY 2013-20 | Head Coach, Georgia Southern 2012-13 | Assistant Coach, Virginia Tech 2012 | Interim Head Coach, College of Charleston 2005-12 | Assistant Coach, College of Charleston 2004-05 | Director of Basketball Operations, Virginia 2002-04 | Graduate Manager, Virginia 2001-02 | Assistant Coach, Hargrave Military Academy",https://jmusports.com//sports/mens-basketball/roster/coaches/mark-byington/3112

A significant uptick in department success has included: 2015-16 .660 overall winning percentage Four CAA Championships Nine NCAA qualifying teams 97th in Learfield Director’s Cup standings 11 All-Americans Eight CAA Players of the Year Five CAA Coaches of the Year 2016-17 .633 overall winning percentage Four CAA Championships Eight NCAA qualifying teams Football national champions 87th in Learfield Director’s Cup standings Ninth in Capital One Cup men’s standings 11 All-Americans Seven CAA Players of the Year Five CAA Coaches of the Year 2017-18 .669 overall winning percentage Five CAA Championships Seven NCAA qualifying teams Two NCAA national title game appearances – football, lacrosse (champions) 81st in Learfield Director’s Cup standings, best since 64th in Bourne’s first year (1999-2000) 12 All-Americans Seven CAA Players of the Year Seven CAA Coaches of the Year 2018-19 .668 overall winning percentage Five CAA Championships Eight NCAA qualifying teams 84th in Learfield Director's Cup standings, second-best in Bourne's 20 years behind 2017-18 10 All-Americans Seven CAA Players of the Year Seven CAA Coaches of the Year Seven student-athletes selected in professional drafts across four different sports 2019-20 (shortened by COVID-19) .624 overall winning percentage Three CAA Championships Four NCAA qualifying teams Two CoSIDA Academic All-Americans 15 All-Americans Six CAA Players of the Year Three student-athletes selected in professional drafts across three different sports Under Bourne’s watch, James Madison football has elevated to one of the premier national programs at the NCAA Football Championship Subdivision level. The Dukes have made 12 postseason football appearances in Bourne’s 21 years at the helm. Beginning with the 2004 national championship, JMU made a run of four out of five years in the playoffs, culminating with the nation’s top-ranked team qualifying for the semifinals in 2008. In the last six years beginning in 2014, JMU has gone 69-14 while making a program-record six consecutive postseason appearances, which also ranks as the third-longest active streak in the FCS. The six-year span also set a program record for consecutive seasons with nine or more victories while increasing the program mark to 17 seasons of a .500 record or better. The successful run encompassed three different head coaches, as Curt Cignetti continued a high standard with a 14-2 campaign in his first season in 2019. The Dukes reached their third national championship game in four years while also capturing the CAA Championship. Beginning in 2016, in three years under Mike Houston, JMU went 37-6, including 36-4 against FCS teams and 22-2 in the CAA. JMU went 14-1 in consecutive seasons under Houston in 2016 and 2017 to set and then tie a program season wins record. JMU captured the 2016 national championship while also halting North Dakota State’s five consecutive national titles and becoming the only team to ever defeat the Bison in the playoffs in the Fargodome. The Dukes rode that momentum into the following season, riding a 26-game winning streak into a second consecutive national title game appearance before falling to NDSU 17-13 in Frisco, Texas. Twice, in 2015 and 2017, JMU jumped out to noteworthy starts while also defeating FBS teams (SMU in 2015 and ECU in 2017) to lure visits by ESPN’s College GameDay for a rare non-FBS show. The 2015 appearance generated $3.6 million in media exposure for the university. The show’s producer proclaimed, “That was, without bias, the greatest scene we’ve ever had for a show. It was unbelievable.” The 2017 show generated $8.5 million in publicity value and attracted a television audience of 1.884 million, compared to 1.713 million for the 2015 show. James Madison further added to its portfolio of excellence across all sports by capturing the 2018 NCAA Division I women’s lacrosse national championship. A senior-laden JMU team went 22-1, including 6-0 against the ACC, and defeated Boston College 16-15 in the championship game in Stony Brook, New York. It was Bourne’s third national title as A.D. as JMU became the first program other than Maryland, North Carolina or Northwestern to earn a women’s lacrosse national title since 2004. In addition to football and the lacrosse national title, other top achievements among numerous sport highlights have included: Women’s basketball posting 15 consecutive seasons of 23 or more victories, including five CAA Championships and six NCAA appearances Men’s basketball CAA Championship, NCAA appearance and NCAA First Four victory in 2013, marking the first NCAA appearance in 19 years and first NCAA win in 30 years Softball posting seven consecutive NCAA appearances (2013-19), including hosting NCAA regionals in 2015 and 2016, hosting LSU in the 2016 Super Regional, and traveling to UCLA in the 2019 Super Regional Men’s soccer captured its 10th CAA title in 2018 and advanced to the NCAA quarterfinals while achieving a final national ranking of No. 8 Several student-athletes were recognized with top national honors, including Kellen Kulbacki as national baseball player of the year in 2006, Jake Lowery as national catcher of the year in 2011, Megan Good as national softball player of the year in 2017, Kristen Gaudian as a lacrosse Tewaaraton finalist in 2018 and multiple FCS football national honors In addition to on-field success, Bourne has positioned JMU Athletics with first-class training and performance venues through strategic facilities growth across all sport programs. Beginning in 2005, JMU opened the Plecker Athletic Performance Center, expanded Bridgeforth Stadium to 25,000 seats, constructed a short-game golf practice facility, opened Veterans Memorial Park for baseball and softball, opened Sentara Park for soccer, lacrosse and track and field, added the JMU Athletics Training Center at Sentara Park for weather-protected all-sport training, built the East Campus Tennis Facility for indoor training and provided first-class surface upgrades for volleyball and field hockey, among other upgrades. In spring of 2015, JMU announced future plans for a state-approved new Convocation Center for basketball and in 2018 broke ground on the facility, to be named the Atlantic Union Bank Center and slated to open in November of 2020. The Plecker Performance Center, which opened in 2005, was the first significant facility project funded primarily through private resources in JMU athletics’ history. The $10 million facility is adjacent to Bridgeforth Stadium/Zane Showker Field and features support areas for football and areas for entertaining during home football games and for JMU’s athletic hall of fame. Also included is the Challace McMillin Academic Center that benefits performers in all JMU sports programs. Advising and counseling for all of JMU student-athletes take place at the facility, which also includes a computer lab and strength training and sports medicine facilities. During the spring of 2015, Bourne unveiled Engaged in Excellence, a new strategic plan engrained with the vision of making JMU the NCAA model of the student-athlete experience. As part of that vision, the Dukes consistently earn top marks in the classroom with over 150 student-athletes annually earning Athletics Director Scholar-Athlete honors with a 3.0 GPA in consecutive semesters among many other academic recognitions across multiple sports. All JMU programs have consistently outpaced the NCAA’s academic performance standards. Additionally under Bourne’s watch, James Madison recently reconfigured student-athlete health operations into the Integrated Health and Sports Performance Program, becoming a trend setter on the national level in terms of a collaborative approach to student-athlete care. The department also launched a new student-athlete leadership program in 2016 to help prepare student-athletes for future success beyond competition. Prior to arriving at JMU in 1999, Bourne served in several athletics roles at Virginia Tech from 1986-97 and was senior associate athletics director at Georgia Tech from 1997-99. At Georgia Tech, he supervised finance, marketing and promotions, ticketing, sports information, and radio and television broadcasts and production. He also was liaison to the Alexander-Tharpe fund, the university’s development arm, and administered baseball and golf. At Virginia Tech, he was associate athletics director during his final two years, and he co-chaired a committee that reviewed gender equity at the school. The committee developed and implemented a plan that brought the school into compliance with federal guidelines and ranked it fifth nationally in compliance. In 2016, Bourne assumed the leadership role among the CAA’s council of athletics directors and has previously served as chair of the NCAA FCS Championship selection committee. In May, 2018, he was honored as one of five finalists nationwide for the Sports Business Journal Athletic Director of the Year Award. In March, 2017, he was honored as an Under Armour FCS Athletics Director of the Year by the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics (NACDA).
