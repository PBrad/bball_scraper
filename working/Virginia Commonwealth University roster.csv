Virginia Commonwealth University,coach,Mike Rhoades,"Mike Rhoades Title Head Coach Email var placeholder = document.getElementById(""emailHtmlHolder""); placeholder.innerHTML = 'vcuhoops@vcu.edu'; Phone 804-828-1278 College Fourth Season Year Lebanon Valley '95 Twitter @CoachRhoades","Mike Rhoades was named the 12th head coach in VCU history on March 21, 2017. It's Rhoades' second go-around with the Rams. As an assistant and associate head coach with VCU from 2009-14, he helped the Rams kick off an unprecedented run of seven straight NCAA Tournament appearances. He’s already set the Rams on a course to reach greater heights. In just his second season in 2018-19, Rhoades led the Rams back to the NCAA Tournament, as well as their first Atlantic 10 Conference outright regular season championship. VCU’s 25 total wins, including 16 conference victories, tied program regular-season marks. For his efforts, he was named Atlantic 10 Conference Coach of the Year and Richmond Times-Dispatch State Coach of the Year, and was a finalist for the Jim Phelan National Coach of the Year award. In three seasons, four Rams have been named to All-Atlantic 10 Conference Teams, including first team selections Marcus Evans and Justin Tillman, as well as 2019-20 All-Rookie team pick Bones Hyland. Rhoades' debut campaign as VCU head coach in 2017-18 produced 18 wins and the program's 18th consecutive winning season. Under his tutelage, Tillman blossomed into a First Team All-Atlantic 10 Conference performer. Tillman also captured All-District honors, as well as the Richmond Times-Dispatch's State College Player of the Year award. Prior to returning to Richmond, Rhoades engineered a stunning turnaround at Rice. As head coach of the Owls from 2014-17, Rhoades led Rice to its first 20-win campaign since 2003-04 and the program’s first postseason appearance since 2011-12. Rice’s 23-12 mark in 2016-17 was an 11-win improvement over the 2015-16 season and the 23 wins were the second-most in Owls history. Rice advanced to the second round of the College Basketball Invitational that season. Rhoades assumed the reins at Rice in 2014-15 and led the school to an immediate five-win improvement. The Owls were a combined 12-49 in the two seasons prior to his arrival. An astute eye for talent, Rhoades recruited Conference USA Rookie of the Year and 2016-17 First Team selection Evans, a Chesapeake, Va., native and landed Arizona State transfer Egor Koulechov, who ranked fifth in C-USA in scoring in 2016-17, two players who helped spark Rice’s dramatic turnaround. In 16 seasons as a collegiate head coach, Rhoades has produced a 305-164 record, a winning percentage of .650. Rhoades’ ties to Central Virginia date back 20 years, including his five seasons at VCU. He was integral in recruiting and developing the players that would lead the Rams to a historic Final Four appearance in 2010-11. During his tenure, VCU reached the NCAA Tournament four times and appeared in the postseason all five years. The Rams were 137-46 during that period and won the 2012 CAA Championship. As a Ram, Rhoades recruited and molded elite-level talent. He played a pivotal role in the signing and development of future NBA players Briante Weber, Treveon Graham and Troy Daniels during his stint on Broad Street, and numerous others have enjoyed successful professional careers overseas. In 2012, after VCU toppled Wichita State in the First Round of the NCAA Tournament, Rhoades was named one of the top 10 assistant coaches under 40 in the country by ESPN.com. Prior to his VCU tenure, Rhoades enjoyed a wildly successful run at Division III Randolph-Macon in Ashland, Va. In 10 seasons as head coach of the Yellow Jackets, Rhoades compiled a 197-76 record (.722 win percentage) and led RMC to four NCAA Tournament appearances, including trips to the Sweet 16 in 2002 and 2003. Rhoades' teams won six Old Dominion Athletic Conference (ODAC) championships and earned national No. 1 rankings in two seasons. He was named ODAC Coach of the Year in three straight seasons from 2001-03, coached three ODAC Players of the Year, five ODAC Freshmen of the Year, as well as 17 First and Second Team All-ODAC selections. In 2003, he was named NABC South District Coach of the Year and State Coach of the Year by the Richmond Times-Dispatch. He began his coaching career at age 23 as an assistant at Randolph-Macon in 1996 under long-time head coach Hal Nunnally. The Yellow Jackets posted winning records in all three seasons with Rhoades on staff before he was elevated to head coach in 1999 at age 25. Rhoades played collegiately under coaches Pat Flannery and Brad McAlester at Lebanon Valley College in his home state of Pennsylvania, and led his squad to a 66-59 overtime win over NYU in the 1994 NCAA Division III National Championship Game. The entire team was inducted into the school's Athletic Hall of Fame in October 2014, the 20th anniversary of the title. The guard was named USA Today D-III National Player of the Year in 1995 and twice earned All-America honors. He graduated with a degree in history in 1995. He left as the school's all-time scoring leader and still holds Lebanon Valley records in free-throw percentage (.845), assists (668) and steals (212). His No. 5 jersey was later retired. Rhoades also earned his masters from VCU’s Center for Sport Leadership in 2002. The Mahanoy City, Pa. native and his wife Jodie have two sons, Logan, and Chase, and one daughter, Porter.

Byers' work over the course of a nearly 15-year coaching career has not gone unnoticed. In 2020, Byers was named one of 50 Impactful Mid-Major Assistant Coaches by Silver Waves Media.

Virginia Commonwealth University,coach,Jamal Brunt,"Jamal Brunt Title Assistant Coach Email var placeholder = document.getElementById(""emailHtmlHolder""); placeholder.innerHTML = 'jbrunt@vcu.edu'; Phone 804-828-4188 College Third Season Year Randolph-Macon '03 Twitter @VCUCoachJB","Jamal Brunt, who helped engineer success at Richmond and Miami, joined Mike Rhoades' VCU staff as assistant coach in the spring of 2018. Brunt’s appointment is his second under Rhoades. The Baltimore, Md. native played for Rhoades at Randolph-Macon and later served on the Yellow Jackets’ staff from 2003-05. Brunt's impact on the VCU program was immediate. Serving as the team's ""defensive coordinator"", Brunt watched as the Rams posted the seventh best defensive efficiency rating (89.5) in the country in 2018-19. VCU also ranked third nationally in effective field goal defense (43.5 percent) and eighth in turnover percentage (23.3). VCU's defensive output was the driving force behind the Rams' 2018-19 Atlantic 10 Conference regular season title and a return to the NCAA Tournament. During his VCU tenure, he has helped the Rams put together consecutive recruiting classes ranked at the top of the A-10. In 2020, Brunt was recognized as one of 50 Impactful Mid-Major Assistant Coaches by Silver Waves Media. Brunt joined VCU following three seasons as assistant coach at Miami (Fla.), where he served as the team’s offensive coordinator. During Brunt’s tenure in Coral Gables, the Hurricanes reached the NCAA Tournament three times, including a Sweet 16 appearance in 2016, and won 20 or more games each season. The 2015-16 team’s 27 wins were the second-most in school history, and that that squad finished the season ranked No. 8 in the USA Today Coaches Poll and No. 10 in the Associated Press Top 25 Poll. The Hurricanes were ranked in the top 15 for a school-record 14 weeks that year. He was an integral piece in landing the best recruiting classes in Miami history in back-to-back seasons. For the 2017-18 campaign, the staff inked three ESPN Top 100 players, including McDonald's All-American and Jordan Brand Classic All-American guard Lonnie Walker. That class was ranked seventh nationally by ESPN, eighth by Scout and 12th by Rivals. In 2016, Brunt helped the Hurricanes assemble a recruiting class that included McDonald’s All-American Dewan Huell, as well as Jordan Brand Classic All-American Bruce Brown. The group was ranked No. 9 by 247Sports, No. 10 by Scout, No. 13 by both ESPN and Rivals. As Miami’s offensive coordinator, Brunt worked closely with 1,000-point scorer (1,343) Davon Reed, who was named Third Team All-ACC and ACC All-Defensive Team. Reed was the recipient of the 2017 Skip Prosser Award, presented annually to the top scholar-athlete in ACC men’s basketball. Brunt also mentored guard Bruce Brown, who recorded just the second triple-double in program history, as well as Sheldon McClellan, who was named USBWA All-District and Second Team All-ACC in 2015-16. In 2015-16, Miami’s offense was ranked 11th nationally in adjusted efficiency. The Hurricanes averaged 75.2 points per game that season, fourth-most in the ACC. Under Brunt’s tutelage, Miami’s .479 field goal percentage that year was its best since the 1988-89 season. Miami’s .749 mark at the free throw line was the program’s best since the 2001-02 season. Prior to Miami, Brunt spent 10 seasons on staff at Richmond. Brunt started at Richmond as director of operations in 2005 and was promoted to an assistant coach in 2007 and associate head coach in 2013. Brunt helped guide Richmond to six postseason appearances, five 20-win seasons and final national rankings of No. 24 in 2009-10 and No. 21 in 2010-11. After winning their first Atlantic 10 Championship in 2010-11, the Spiders advanced to the NCAA Sweet 16. In 2015, Brunt helped Richmond earn a top-four seed in the National Invitation Tournament, falling to eventual runner-up Miami in the quarterfinals. In seven of Brunt’s last eight seasons at Richmond, the Spiders defeated 12 nationally-ranked opponents. From 2009-14, Richmond earned more wins than any other Atlantic 10 school, averaging 21.5 over that span. In addition to on-court coaching, Brunt was responsible for scheduling, which helped the Spiders consistently carve out a top-100 RPI, and aided Richmond’s march to an NCAA at-large bid in 2010. Richmond finished in the top-100 of the RPI in five of Brunt’s last six seasons. The Spiders finished 25th in RPI in 2010 and 41st in 2011. In his six seasons as an assistant, Brunt was integral in signing some of the most highly touted recruits in school history, beating out “Power Five” programs in the process. In 2011, Richmond’s Justin Harper was selected 32nd overall in the NBA Draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers. Brunt also mentored Spider student-athletes in academics, helping the men’s basketball team achieve its highest GPA on record. Before joining the Spiders basketball staff in the summer of 2005, Brunt was an assistant coach alongside Rhoades at Randolph-Macon for the 2003-04 and 2004-05 seasons. At Randolph-Macon, Brunt was involved in all aspects of coaching, including player development, recruiting, monitoring academics, film exchange and breakdown, opponent scouting and on-court coaching. Brunt played four seasons as a guard for Rhoades from 1999-2003 and helped lift the Yellow Jackets to NCAA Division III Sweet 16 appearances in 2002 and 2003. He received a bachelor’s degree in international relations with a concentration in business economics from Randolph-Macon in 2003. He is married to the former Erica Glasper. The couple has two daughters, Peyton and Price, as well as a son, Jalen.

Virginia Commonwealth University,coach,Daniel Roose,"Daniel Roose Title Director of Sports Performance for Men's Basketball Email var placeholder = document.getElementById(""emailHtmlHolder""); placeholder.innerHTML = 'djroose@vcu.edu'; College Eighth season Year Appalachian State '01 Twitter @CoachRoose","The former Director of Sports Performance for Men’s Basketball on Shaka Smart’s staff at both VCU (2009-15) and Texas (2016-19), Daniel Roose returned to VCU to take on the same role under Head Coach Mike Rhoades in August of 2019. Roose, certified as a Master Strength and Conditioning Coach, has played a major role in the development of a number of NBA players, including first round draft picks Mo Bamba, Jarrett Allen and Jaxson Hayes at Texas, as well as Larry Sanders, Troy Daniels, Treveon Graham and Briante Weber during his initial VCU tenure. The 41-year-old Roose served as Director of Sports Performance for Men’s Basketball during each of Smart’s six years at VCU. The Rams posted an overall record of 163-56 (.744) and made five NCAA Tournament appearances, including the 2011 Final Four, during that time. VCU and Duke were the only two programs in the country to record at least 26 wins in each of those six seasons. In addition, VCU was one of only 11 schools in the nation to earn an NCAA Tournament bid each year from 2011-15 (Cincinnati, Duke, Gonzaga, Kansas, Louisville, Michigan State, North Carolina, Ohio State, San Diego State and Wisconsin). The Rams’ NCAA appearance in 2015 marked the first time in school history VCU had advanced to the Big Dance five straight years, and the first time in the history of the Commonwealth of Virginia that a Division I basketball program had accomplished that feat. Smart’s style of play during his time at VCU was termed “Havoc.” Simply stated, it was a high-octane platform marked by full-court pressure and transition offense. Roose was the architect of the physical conditioning program needed to play that style of basketball. The Rams led the country in steals per game for three consecutive seasons (2011-12, 2012-13 and 2013-14) and ranked fourth nationally in 2014-15 (9.5 spg). In 2012-13, VCU’s 422 total steals shattered the Atlantic 10 single-season record of 352 set by Xavier in 1998-99. The 422 thefts marked the 18th-highest single-season total in NCAA Division I history. During the 2013-14 season, the Rams registered 391 steals, 21 more than any other squad. VCU also ranked near the top of the national statistics in turnover margin and opponent turnover rate under Smart’s guidance. The Rams led the nation in turnover margin in 2011-12 (+6.47) and 2012-13 (+8.03) and ranked third nationally (+5.4) during the 2014-15 season. VCU’s +8.03 mark in 2012-13 was the sixth-best turnover margin by a NCAA Division I team since the 1992-93 season. Roose and Smart’s tenure in VCU will be forever linked to the magical 2010-11 season, which saw the Rams advance to the NCAA Final Four for the first time in school history. VCU posted a 28-12 overall record, including a 12-6 mark in CAA play, and earned a No. 11 seed in the NCAA Tournament. Forced to play in a First Four game in Dayton, the Rams registered five consecutive upsets in what many experts called the greatest run to the Final Four in tournament history. Along the way, VCU defeated “Power 5” schools USC (59-46), Georgetown (74-56), Purdue (94-76), Florida State (72-71 OT) and Kansas (71-61). VCU, which fell to Butler in the NCAA semifinals, finished the season ranked No. 6 in the final ESPN/USA Today Coaches poll, the highest in school and CAA history. Prior to his arrival at VCU, Roose spent two years at North Carolina-Pembroke (2007-09). He oversaw the strength and conditioning program of all 16 athletic teams for the Braves. Roose served as a graduate assistant at Marshall for one season (2004-05) and then transitioned into a role as director of strength and conditioning for the Thundering Herd for three years (2005-07). He worked directly with the basketball, volleyball, baseball and softball teams, but oversaw and designed training programs for all 15 varsity sports for the Thundering Herd. He also spent one year (2003-04) at Campbell, where he served as the head strength and conditioning coach for the Camels. Roose earned his bachelor’s degree in physical education from Appalachian State in 2001. He later earned his master’s degree in exercise physiology from Marshall in 2006. In 2019, Roose was named Master Strength and Conditioning Coach by the Collegiate Strenght and Conditioning Coaches association (CSCCa), the highest honor given in the profession. A native of Troy, N.C., Roose was born on Oct. 10, 1977. He and his wife, Laura, have one son, Devin and one daughter, Anna.
