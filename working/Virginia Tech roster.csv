Adding a staff and six scholarship players in a hurry, Young’s first season in Blacksburg started off with a bang, as the Hokies went down to South Carolina and defeated Clemson in style to give Young his first Hokie and ACC win, as well as his 300th career victory. Another big-time W came at the prestigious Maui Jim Maui Invitational against then-No. 3 Michigan State. On ESPN2 with Dan Shulman and Jay Bilas on the call, the young Hokies (7 of the 9 rotation players were underclassmen) pulled off one of the bigger upsets of the season with a 71-66 win. With the upset of Sparty, it marked the first time since 1964 that Tech beat a top-five team in nonconference play. Despite being the shortest and second-youngest squad among high-major conference teams, Young and Co. tallied 16 wins to make it the most victories by a first-year head coach at Tech since 1999-00 and tied for the fifth-most wins ever by a first-year Hokie coach. He also became the first coach to win two of his first three road ACC games in school history. Leaning on a mix of young and old in his first season, Young developed junior Wabissa Bede into one of the finer point guards in the country, as Bede would go on to finish with the sixth-best assist-to-turnover ratio nationally (3.34) and first in the ACC. And under Young’s tutelage, redshirt freshman Tyrece Radford blossomed into one of the better all-around players in the league, with being one of only two players in the ACC to average 10 points, six rebounds and shoot over 60 percent from the field. Records at Tech: Under the direction of Young, the Hokies put together some new records during the 2019-20 season. On Nov. 20 versus Delaware State, Tech racked up 21 3-pointers, marking the most in school history and the most ever by an ACC team. Speaking of 3s, the 315 hit last season were the second-most in school history. Four freshmen hit 49 or more 3-pointers, which was the most by any program in over the last 25 years. Behind the young bucks, Tech finished 13th nationally in 3-pointers made per game with 9.9 triples a contest, which was the most in school history. Utilizing its freshmen on the offensive end last year, Tech finished with its freshmen averaging 50.7 points per game, which is the fourth-most in ACC history behind Duke’s 2018-19, 2017-18, 1982-83 teams. Making sure his team played the game the right way by limiting miscues, Young’s prowess showed on Dec. 29 when Tech committed only two turnovers against Maryland Eastern Shore to tie a school record. The Hokies would go on to finish fourth in the nation in fewest turnovers committed per game (9.9). Prior to Virginia Tech: The Radford, Virginia native joined the Hokies after a record-setting 17-year tenure as the head coach at Wofford. The Terriers posted a 30-5 overall record in 2018-19, including a perfect 18-0 mark in Southern Conference play, and registered a convincing 84-68 win over Seton Hall in the first round of the 2019 NCAA Tournament. The 2019 Sporting News Coach of the Year, Young built the Terriers into one of the Southern Conference's preeminent programs and a perennial NCAA Tournament participant. He guided Wofford to five NCAA Tournament berths over the past 10 seasons and five Southern Conference championships. In addition to the on-court success of his teams, 100 percent of Young's student-athletes at Wofford who completed their eligibility graduated. Producing high-caliber players, Young helped groom the NCAA’s leader for most 3-pointers made in a career in Fletcher Magee with 509, a two-time SoCon Player of the Year at Wofford. Over his career, Young has developed three AP All-America selections, four SoCon Player of the Year and 34 all-conference selections. Of Note: Young compiled a 299-244 (.551) overall record at Wofford and earned Southern Conference Coach of the Year honors four times (2010, 2014, 2015 and 2019). Under his guidance, the Terriers registered an impressive list of nonconference wins, including ones over the likes of Auburn, Cincinnati, Clemson, Georgia, Georgia Tech, NC State, Purdue, Seton Hall, South Carolina, Virginia Tech, Xavier and Wake Forest. Arguably the most compelling nonconference victory of his tenure at Wofford came on Dec. 20, 2017 when the Terriers faced then-No. 5 North Carolina at the Dean Smith Center in Chapel Hill, North Carolina and registered a 79-75 victory over head coach Roy Williams and the Tar Heels. In addition to owning numerous coaching accolades, Young currently serves as a member of the NCAA's Men's Basketball Ethics Committee. Before being a head coach: Prior to assuming the head coaching reins for the Terriers in 2002-03, Young was an assistant coach to current Wofford Director of Athletics Richard Johnson.
