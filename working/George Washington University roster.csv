Christian led the Mount to a pair of NCAA Tournament appearances and a 67-39 conference record in six seasons before taking the helm at Siena, where he led the Saints to a nine-win improvement in his lone season. “We aspire to become a perennial contender in the Atlantic 10 Conference and to do so, we need a leader with relentless optimism, positivity and basketball acumen,"" said Director of Athletics and Recreation Tanya Vogel. ""We have found that in Jamion Christian. His passion for teaching and his endless energy to get the absolute best out of each individual in his program is infectious. I am confident in Coach Christian’s ability to build a sustainable program that is in the national conversation again soon.” “I am honored to be able to return home to take a job I have dreamed of having since I was a child,” said Christian. “I’d like to thank President Thomas LeBlanc for this incredible opportunity. It was a difficult decision to leave Siena because I absolutely loved the people, but there were only a few jobs that could take me away, and I can’t wait to get to work in Foggy Bottom. GW has a rich basketball history and the potential to become a juggernaut in the Atlantic 10. I’m looking forward to bringing an exciting style of basketball to the nation’s capital that all of the Buff and Blue faithful will be proud of. Our brand of basketball contains enthusiasm and great connectivity. We can’t wait to pump our love into our players each and every day. The journey to be at our best begins immediately. I am so incredibly excited to be your head coach.” A native of New Kent, Virginia, Christian made an immediate impact at Siena, implementing a pressure defense and an offense built around protecting the ball and three-point shooting. His “Mayhem” brand of basketball saw the Saints improve from 251st to 43rd nationally in scoring defense, 322nd to eighth in fewest turnovers, and 250th to 74th in 3-point field goals per game.
