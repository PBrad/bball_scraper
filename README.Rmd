## Description

This repo compiles roster / biographical information on college basketball players for the 2020-21 season. The scraper works for "sidearm" sites, pulling names, basic header info (e.g., position, height/weight for players and title for coaches/staff), and bios. While the scraper pulls in the bio information systematically, schools vary in how they format / input this information, so additional cleanup will be needed.
